This blog talks about the fascinating science of the oceans, atmosphere, cryosphere, land, and the biosphere that collectively make up the Earth Climate System. Every month, a new scientific article is discussed here in an approachable language that everyone can understand! I am always on the lookout for new collaborators who would like to contribute to this blog, please contact me if you too are a climate geek and want to make the science more accessible to a wide audience.
