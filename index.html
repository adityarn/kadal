Arctic ice cap is rapidly melting, but what is happening to the
Antarctic?</h1>
<p><strong>First published: 15th February, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The polar regions are well known for their ice caps. In Antarctica,
the land is covered in kilometers thick ice sheets, while the ocean
surrounding the landmass freezes to form a large sea ice field extending
to about 20 million kilometers every winter. Sea ice forms when the cold
polar air freezes the surface seawater during winter. Sea ice is an
important component of the Earth’s climate system. Ice is highly
reflective, hence sheltering the seawater below from solar radiation.
Ice rejects brine as it forms and makes the surrounding waters salty,
hence making the polar regions very weakly stratified. This allows for
efficient mixing of deep warm waters with cooler surface waters and is
an important part of the global thermohaline circulation. Sea ice is a
critical component of the planet’s climate and understanding how sea ice
will respond to the changing climate is essential if we want to to
accurately represent and forecast climate in our computer models.</p>
<p>Both the poles have seen summer sea ice declining over the last few
years, with the Arctic having seen a decline for multiple decades. Sea
ice extent during summer have fallen at about <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL029703">-8%
per decade since the 1950s</a>. The decline of sea ice around Antarctica
began more recently, around the year 2016. February 2023 may break all
records for the lowest sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean! This
decline is mainly driven by the excess heat that we have put into the
climate system by emitting greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>Unintuitive though it may be, the warming climate did not result in a
reduction of sea ice in the Antarctic until 2016! In fact, sea ice
concentration increased by about <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL059239">12%
in the period from 1979 – 2011.</a> During the same period, the surface
air has been warming over the Southern Ocean. The response of sea ice to
a warming climate is quite complex as it is affected by the radiation in
the atmosphere, the winds, the precipitation, the ocean currents, and
the melting of glaciers along the coastline. Further, the overall trend
of increasing sea ice <em>hides regional differences</em>. The West
Antarctic seas saw a decline in sea ice over this period of time. But
the increase in sea ice in other regions was larger, thus leading to an
overall increasing trend.</p>
<p>The reasons are still a matter of scientific inquiry, but we have
good candidate answers that can explain the trends we have seen this
far. I will explain the current state of the science around this crucial
question – why did the Southern Ocean sea ice field take so long to
start melting under a warmer climate?</p>
<p>Before considering candidate answers to our question, we need to
understand the factors that affect the sea ice field. Heat can come from
above or from below. The atmosphere controls the radiative heat transfer
to the ocean, the winds can carry heat away and also control the rate of
evaporation, and finally precipitation also results in heat transfer.
The winds push sea ice, and depending on the pattern of winds, sea ice
can be bunched together or pushed apart. Coastal winds act to push sea
ice away, making coastal regions a site of production and export of sea
ice.</p>
<p>From below, the ocean circulation affects how heat moves around the
global ocean. In the polar regions, surface waters are colder than
waters at depth. If the deep water can make it to the surface, it can
elevate the temperatures there. This upwelling of deep waters is
controlled by the global thermohaline circulation – the large scale
overturning of waters from the equator to the poles. Ocean currents and
the westerly belt of winds control the upwelling of these deep waters <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1pvI6ZJ1Mk&amp;t=36s">(click here
to see a video of deep waters spiralling upwards around Antarctica)</a>.
Additionally, the surface stratification of the ocean controls the
amount of upwelled waters that can mix with the surface waters. The
amount of freshwater that flows into the ocean from melting glaciers and
from atmospheric precipitation determine how strongly or weakly
stratified the surface ocean is. Weaker surface stratification allows
more of the warm deep water to mix with the surface, whereas, fresher
waters are lighter and they tend to inhibit the mixing of upwelled deep
waters.</p>
<p>Now that we understand that sea ice is found within a complex web of
interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and the cryosphere, we can
start exploring the factors that led to sea ice growth from the 1970s to
2016, and the eventual decline since then.</p>
<p>One of the leading theories suggests that the ocean played a major
role in our story. <a
href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/11/jcli4136.1.xml">A
study based on computer models</a> was able to replicate the trends that
satellites have observed and found that increasing air temperatures
first acted to suppress sea ice growth. The amount of sea ice is
determined by how much ice grows in a season versus how much is melted
away. Increasing air temperatures slowed down the growth of sea ice. Sea
ice does not retain much of the salt and tends to reject brine as it
grows, thus dumping a lot of salt into the surface water. The
suppression of sea ice growth freshened the surface waters. Fresher
waters are more strongly stratified, losing their connection with the
warmer waters that lie at depth. With lesser heat making it to the
surface from the deep ocean, less heat was available to melt the sea
ice. So we had a situation where sea ice growth slowed down, but the
melting of sea ice slowed down even more, hence leading to an overall
buildup of sea ice!</p>
<p>But then, what led to the reduction in sea ice since the year 2016?
Once again, our answer seems to lie with the warm deep waters. Deep
waters rise to the surface in giant ocean gyres. <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00624-1">Liping Zhang and their
co-authors</a> used computer simulations of the Earth’s climate to find
that there was a buildup of heat in the subsurface ocean, largely due to
stronger winds. Winds in the Southern Ocean are responsible for driving
a vertical pump <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_transport">(Ekman pump)</a>
that pulls warm waters from deep below. They do this by pushing surface
waters apart horizontally and creating a drop in height of the surface
of the sea. The spinup of the winds drove a stronger vertical pump which
led to the buildup of heat below the surface layer of the ocean. Warmer
waters are lighter, making the subsurface light enough to eventually
break the stratification which allowed greater mixing of warm waters
with surface waters. This process may be the reason why sea ice reduced
since 2016 in the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The question though is not yet settled! There are many changes
occuring to the atmosphere, our climate, the cryosphere, the winds and
the major gyre systems that we don’t fully understand. These
uncertainties are some of the largest uncertainties in climate model
simulations that inform the IPCC reports. It is becoming more and more
clear to people across the world that our climate is undergoing rapid
change, and governments would like more fine-grained forecasts of our
future climate. Settling these uncertainties in the polar regions would
go a long way in addressing that need!</p>
