considerations for ocean-based carbon dioxide removal technologies</h1>
<p><strong>First published: 5th of April 2024</strong></p>
<p>Climate change emerges as a direct result of the historical and
ongoing economic models rooted in capitalism and global trade, fostering
and perpetuating global inequality. This period has seen a significant
transfer of material and labor from the Global South to the Global
North. As the planet warms, largely due to carbon emissions from the
economic activities of the Global North or those serving its interests,
the capacity to adapt to climate change predominantly resides within the
Global North. Meanwhile, large populations face energy poverty and lack
access to essential life necessities like food, shelter, and energy.</p>
<p>It is in this context that we see modern attempts at mitigating and
removing carbon emissions from our climate system. Multiple new
organisations aim to remove carbon by deploying large scale carbon
dioxide removal (CDR) technologies that are currently unproven and may
result in ecological damage. Much of the work on long term policy and
action is taking place in countries that have the money to back up their
vision. This is an exclusionary process that does not take into account
the perspectives of people from the Global South.</p>
<p>An example from the recent past is the carbon credit system which is
a business as usual approach where polluters continue to pollute, but
are able to purchase the right to pollute from poorer parts of the
world. This incentivizes the lack of development of the Global South
economies that seek to participate in these markets, where their
economies would primarily be engaged in the task of deploying CDR
technologies. It is essentially a market-based approach seeking to
address a market failure that in the past treated environment pollution
as a “negative externality”.</p>
<p>At a talk given by the CEO of a “non-profit” organisation engaged in
ocean CDR research, I was amazed to hear the plan that their
organisation envisages for our future planet. It is indeed true that
reducing emissions is no longer enough if we would like to stay below 2
to 2.5ºC warming by the end of the century. This requires carbon drawal,
or negative emissions. In this future world, a large fraction of
additional renewable energy production capacity will be used to run
enormous machines that will become part of the CDR network. In such a
world a large proportion of material and resources would go towards
building this new economy of CDR technologies. This means that currently
energy starved populations will have to compete with the CDR sector for
access to energy, pushing the price of energy up for everyone. This very
model is being marketed as a progressive economic model for the Global
South. Their existence in this world is to service the needs of the
Global North, where consumption will continue to drive emissions, and
the carbon offsets will have to come from a massive deployment of as yet
untested technologies with possible dire consequences for the
environment in the Global South.</p>
<p>The poor will have to keep cleaning up what the rich choose to dump
into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Organisations engaged in ocean CDR seek to operate in the global
ocean. However, for easy access to deployment sites, they need to be
situated close to the coast. This would mean that the primary sites of
such CDR deployment will not be over remote parts of the deep ocean, but
close to coastal communities, close to waters which coastal communities
rely on for their food. People in the Global North have been very vocal
about their lack of confidence in unproven and untested technologies. In
some cases, the German public has even been resistant towards the
deployment of renewable sources of power such as wind turbines and solar
plants. They have also protested against the deployment of solar
geoengineering technologies. This leaves the Global South as the most
politically suitable site for deploying untested CDR and mitigation
technologies. Weak environmental regulatory capacity within public
institutions in these countries allow for a more fuss-free deployment of
potentially harmful technologies. Further, countries with more
autocratic governments are able to quell civil resistance movements more
thoroughly. Elite capture of power in the Global South, with the active
help of the Global North has led to a situation where the amount of
money that these new economies might bring in will almost always trump
the concerns of local populations.</p>
<p>How can we get more participation of voices from the Global South in
such initiatives? It is not enough for these organisations to simply say
that they are focussing on more global outreach. Any solution to come
out of the Global North requires the participation of the Global South.
Such participation needs to be on equal terms on a mutually beneficial
basis. Much of what has happened in the past has been one sided. For
example, with BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), most of
the social and ecological burdens are borne by the Global South while
the richer economies benefit from the carbon credits that they are able
to purchase from the large-scale diversion of agricultural land in the
Global South.</p>
<p>COVID was an example when there was a global crisis. Much was said
about how the whole world was in it together. But when it came to actual
action, the Global North cornered much of the vaccine supply with many
North American and European countries having secured enough vaccine
doses to vaccinate their populations 5 times over. This is an example of
how the disproportionate resources that are available to richer
countries can quickly be leveraged to gain exclusive access to solutions
that will allow their people and societies to go back to living life as
normally as possible. This however, leaves out a large chunk of the
global population to essentially fend for itself. The Global South is at
once a solution and a potential source of unwanted climate refugees for
the Global North. The solution being pursued is a way to prevent the
worst outcomes of climate change while ensuring that they deploy
resources to adapt, build walls, install cooling and so on while
continuing to consume at the same level. This is not just unjust to the
Global South, but is unjust to the poor within the Global North who also
suffer from the lack of access to resources, private and public, to
mitigate and adapt to the changing climate.</p>
<p>Historically, the Global North has fiercely protected access to
technology through <a
href="https://sunypress.edu/Books/P/Power-and-Ideas2">unjust IPR
regimes</a> while calling for greater global trade. Today, the Global
North has given up on the façade it had put up of supporting greater
global trade. By blocking appointments to the <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/reform-die-usa-washington-world-trade-organization-wto-ngozi-okonjo-iweala-joe-biden/">WTO
commission, the USA has engineered</a> a situation where it is able to
circumvent the same rules that it had so fiercely enforced upon
developing countries. Today’s erection of trade barriers against China
is another example of how the Global North is willing to change its
stance on global trade whenever it suits its own immediate geopolitical
needs. Further, China is prevented from accessing advanced computer
chips technologies which are a key element in the artificial
intelligence sector. It is in such a context that technological
optimists are functioning. We have no guarantee that future CDR
technologies will be accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>This is not to say that technological solutions such as
geoengineering or CDR should not be explored at all. The primary focus
of this article has been at the <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/reassessing-the-need-for-carbon-dioxide-removal-moral-implications-of-alternative-climate-target-pathways/364480FBBB60784AB5C6996699E77740">moral
framing of such activities</a>, which remain blind to the needs of the
global poor, both in the South and in the North. <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666278723000107">Techno-optimists
are failing to take these concerns into consideration.</a> Organisations
engaged in building ocean CDR policy will benefit from hiring more
people from indigenous and under-represented communities in the Global
North and more people in general from the Global South. They also need
to hire more experts from the social sciences and humanities so that
they bring in the diverse perspectives that are currently missing in
their overall vision.</p>

Arctic ice cap is rapidly melting, but what is happening to the
Antarctic?</h1>
<p><strong>First published: 15th February, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The polar regions are well known for their ice caps. In Antarctica,
the land is covered in kilometers thick ice sheets, while the ocean
surrounding the landmass freezes to form a large sea ice field extending
to about 20 million kilometers every winter. Sea ice forms when the cold
polar air freezes the surface seawater during winter. Sea ice is an
important component of the Earth’s climate system. Ice is highly
reflective, hence sheltering the seawater below from solar radiation.
Ice rejects brine as it forms and makes the surrounding waters salty,
hence making the polar regions very weakly stratified. This allows for
efficient mixing of deep warm waters with cooler surface waters and is
an important part of the global thermohaline circulation. Sea ice is a
critical component of the planet’s climate and understanding how sea ice
will respond to the changing climate is essential if we want to to
accurately represent and forecast climate in our computer models.</p>
<p>Both the poles have seen summer sea ice declining over the last few
years, with the Arctic having seen a decline for multiple decades. Sea
ice extent during summer have fallen at about <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL029703">-8%
per decade since the 1950s</a>. The decline of sea ice around Antarctica
began more recently, around the year 2016. February 2023 may break all
records for the lowest sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean! This
decline is mainly driven by the excess heat that we have put into the
climate system by emitting greenhouse gases.</p>
<p><img src="./Images/AntSeaIceNSIDC_14022023.png"
     alt="plot of Antarctic sea ice extent"
     width="500"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /></p>
<p>Unintuitive though it may be, the warming climate did not result in a
reduction of sea ice in the Antarctic until 2016! In fact, sea ice
concentration increased by about <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL059239">12%
in the period from 1979 – 2011.</a> During the same period, the surface
air has been warming over the Southern Ocean. The response of sea ice to
a warming climate is quite complex as it is affected by the radiation in
the atmosphere, the winds, the precipitation, the ocean currents, and
the melting of glaciers along the coastline. Further, the overall trend
of increasing sea ice <em>hides regional differences</em>. The West
Antarctic seas saw a decline in sea ice over this period of time. But
the increase in sea ice in other regions was larger, thus leading to an
overall increasing trend.</p>
<p>The reasons are still a matter of scientific inquiry, but we have
good candidate answers that can explain the trends we have seen this
far. I will explain the current state of the science around this crucial
question – why did the Southern Ocean sea ice field take so long to
start melting under a warmer climate?</p>
<p>Before considering candidate answers to our question, we need to
understand the factors that affect the sea ice field. Heat can come from
above or from below. The atmosphere controls the radiative heat transfer
to the ocean, the winds can carry heat away and also control the rate of
evaporation, and finally precipitation also results in heat transfer.
The winds push sea ice, and depending on the pattern of winds, sea ice
can be bunched together or pushed apart. Coastal winds act to push sea
ice away, making coastal regions a site of production and export of sea
ice.</p>
<p>From below, the ocean circulation affects how heat moves around the
global ocean. In the polar regions, surface waters are colder than
waters at depth. If the deep water can make it to the surface, it can
elevate the temperatures there. This upwelling of deep waters is
controlled by the global thermohaline circulation – the large scale
overturning of waters from the equator to the poles. Ocean currents and
the westerly belt of winds control the upwelling of these deep waters <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1pvI6ZJ1Mk&amp;t=36s">(click here
to see a video of deep waters spiralling upwards around Antarctica)</a>.
Additionally, the surface stratification of the ocean controls the
amount of upwelled waters that can mix with the surface waters. The
amount of freshwater that flows into the ocean from melting glaciers and
from atmospheric precipitation determine how strongly or weakly
stratified the surface ocean is. Weaker surface stratification allows
more of the warm deep water to mix with the surface, whereas, fresher
waters are lighter and they tend to inhibit the mixing of upwelled deep
waters.</p>
<p>Now that we understand that sea ice is found within a complex web of
interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and the cryosphere, we can
start exploring the factors that led to sea ice growth from the 1970s to
2016, and the eventual decline since then.</p>
<p>One of the leading theories suggests that the ocean played a major
role in our story. <a
href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/11/jcli4136.1.xml">A
study based on computer models</a> was able to replicate the trends that
satellites have observed and found that increasing air temperatures
first acted to suppress sea ice growth. The amount of sea ice is
determined by how much ice grows in a season versus how much is melted
away. Increasing air temperatures slowed down the growth of sea ice. Sea
ice does not retain much of the salt and tends to reject brine as it
grows, thus dumping a lot of salt into the surface water. The
suppression of sea ice growth freshened the surface waters. Fresher
waters are more strongly stratified, losing their connection with the
warmer waters that lie at depth. With lesser heat making it to the
surface from the deep ocean, less heat was available to melt the sea
ice. So we had a situation where sea ice growth slowed down due to
warmer air temperatures, but the melting of sea ice due to warm water
supply from deep below slowed down even more, hence leading to an
overall buildup of sea ice!</p>
<p>But then, what led to the reduction in sea ice since the year 2016?
Once again, our answer seems to lie with the warm deep waters. Deep
waters rise to the surface in giant ocean gyres. <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00624-1">Liping Zhang and their
co-authors</a> used computer simulations of the Earth’s climate to find
that there was a buildup of heat in the subsurface ocean, largely due to
stronger winds. Winds in the Southern Ocean are responsible for driving
a vertical pump <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_transport">(Ekman pump)</a>
that pulls warm waters from deep below. They do this by pushing surface
waters apart horizontally and creating a drop in height of the surface
of the sea. The spinup of the winds drove a stronger vertical pump which
led to the buildup of heat below the surface layer of the ocean. Warmer
waters are lighter, making the subsurface light enough to eventually
break the stratification which allowed greater mixing of warm waters
with surface waters. This process may be the reason why sea ice reduced
since 2016 in the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The question though is not yet settled! There are many changes
occuring to the atmosphere, our climate, the cryosphere, the winds and
the major gyre systems that we don’t fully understand. These
uncertainties are some of the <a
href="https://os.copernicus.org/articles/17/59/2021/">largest
uncertainties in climate model simulations that inform the IPCC
reports</a>. It is becoming more and more clear to people across the
world that our climate is undergoing rapid change, and governments would
like more fine-grained forecasts of our future climate. Settling these
uncertainties in the polar regions would go a long way in addressing
that need!</p>
